# cryptography_Steganography_AES
use python, for steganography, conceal message within a file (image here). AES, baby block to encode &amp; decode AES



For AES:

Blocks, Bytes and Nibbles 
A block is 8 bits (or one byte, or one ASCII character). A key is 8 bits (or one byte). A block is treated as consisting of four nibbles, each nibble being two bits. 
 
A block is 8 bits: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. 
 
Nibbles are: 1 2,     3 4,     5 6,     7 8. 
 
A nibble can be treated either as two bits or as a number in arithmetic modulo 4 (that is, a number in the range 0âˆ’3).
